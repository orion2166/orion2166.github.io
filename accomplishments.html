                <p> Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon features a 1.5-mile swim from Alcatraz Island to the shores of the St. Francis Yacht Club, a grueling 18-mile bike ride, and a demanding 8-mile run through the trails of the Golden Gate Recreational Area. Set against the natural beauty of San Francisco, this thrilling triathlon is a virtual postcard of the City by the Bay. </p>
                <p> I had a great time being part of the Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon. I competed and completed the triathlon. It was, even more, fun to compete against the United States Rio Olympic Athletes. I didn't beat them but it was fun standing next to them and competing against them. This was one of the most physical events I attended and I hope to improve and do better next time. </p>

                <p> The Trirock Triatholon in austin is a fun triatholon that requires the person to Swim 1500 Meters, Bike 24.9 Miles, and Run 6.2 Miles. The triatholon uses the austin river. Personally I loved the trathlon it allowed me to see the austin area while competing in a pysical activty event. The main purpose of this triathlon for me was to prepare for the Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon. </p>

I have been gardening for a few years and have grown many fruit and vegetables. The best is that they are organic. Usually, what I grow I give out to all my friends and family</p>

                    <p> I have had a great passion for horseback riding. The style is used in English Riding. I have been great at the sport and have done it for 14 years. I would have done competitions if it wasn't for cost to join. I also did not have a horse the only way I could have done it for so long is thanks to camps and working for them. </p>
