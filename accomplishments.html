                <p> Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon features a 1.5-mile swim from Alcatraz Island to the shores of the St. Francis Yacht Club, a grueling 18-mile bike ride, and a demanding 8-mile run through the trails of the Golden Gate Recreational Area. Set against the natural beauty of San Francisco, this thrilling triathlon is a virtual postcard of the City by the Bay. </p>
                <p> I had a great time being part of the Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon. I competed and completed the triathlon. It was, even more, fun to compete against the United States Rio Olympic Athletes. I didn't beat them but it was fun standing next to them and competing against them. This was one of the most physical events I attended and I hope to improve and do better next time. </p>

                    <p> I love to garden. For some reason, I have always loved digging and using my hands. I have been gardening for a few years and have grown many fruit and vegetables. The best is that they are organic. Usually, what I grow I give out to all my friends</p>

                    <p> I truly understand this is a cliche. But I do love to program and working on different projects. I have 60 repositories on my GitHub. The projects range from physical Arduino and drones. To mobile, software, and website development If you want to see some just click on my projects. </p>

                    <p> I have had a great passion for horseback riding. The style is used in English Riding. I have been great at the sport and have done it for 14 years. I would have done competitions if it wasn't expensive to join. I also did not have a horse the only way I could have done it for so long is thanks to camps and working for them. </p>

                    <p> I am a great swimmer. I have been swimming for 21 years and still love it. I can't keep my self away from the water. I have gone to competitions. Swimming is fun and I hope to keep it up and possibly start into scuba diving and deep sea diving. </p>
